Build a mobile-first PWA called Manifestly, an AI-powered manifestation app that monetizes the Barnum effect. Users receive emotionally personalized “divine” insights that feel unique and true, with instant upsells and shareable outputs.

Functional Requirements

1. Core Flow

Landing page → “What are you feeling today?” text input.

On submit → AI generates a Barnum-style message (using OpenAI API).

Display as an animated “Energy Card” (smooth fade-in, calm gradient).

Add CTA buttons:

🔮 “Reveal Deeper Insight” → triggers Stripe $1.99 checkout

💎 “Unlock Unlimited Readings” → Stripe $9.99/month subscription

📤 “Share My Message” → generates an auto-formatted quote image (with app watermark + background gradient)



2. Manifestation Mode

User types a desire or goal.

AI converts it into a 3-sentence affirmation (present-tense, cinematic).

Option to play gentle background music (use royalty-free loop).


3. Emotional Hook Engine

Detect emotion in user text (“lost”, “in love”, “stressed”, “hopeful”)

Tailor response tone accordingly (calming, empowering, romantic, etc.).


4. Monetization

Stripe integration:

One-time purchase ($1.99)

Subscription ($9.99/month)


Store purchases in Supabase table payments with userId + type + timestamp.


5. Database (Supabase)

users: id, email (optional), subscriptionStatus

messages: id, userId, input, aiResponse, emotion, timestamp

payments: id, userId, amount, type, timestamp


6. Viral Growth

“Share my message” → creates an image (quote + gradient background + watermark “✨ Manifestly”) ready for TikTok/Instagram.

Add “streak badge” counter (number of consecutive days user engaged).

AI Logic

Prompt for message generation:

> You are a mystical guide who delivers emotionally resonant insights. Write a short 3-sentence message that sounds divinely inspired but universally relatable. It should feel as if written personally for the user. Use warm, poetic language.



Prompt for manifestation mode:

> Turn the user’s desire into a 3-sentence affirmation written in present tense, filled with gratitude and certainty.

Backend Logic

Use OpenAI API (GPT-5) for message generation.

Store user interactions in Supabase.

Use Stripe Checkout for payments (test + live keys).

After purchase → unlock premium mode (unlimited messages + affirmations).

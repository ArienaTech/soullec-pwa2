# Soullec - AI-Powered Spiritual Guidance App

  - **Anonymous users continue working without login** - 1 daily free gem or pay-per-use

  - **Complete profile merge**: Transfers all profile data (birthDate, religion, horoscope preferences, etc.)
  - **Message/payment history**: All anonymous messages and payments transferred to authenticated account
  - **Race-condition safe**: Transfer dependencies first ‚Üí merge data ‚Üí delete anonymous user
  - **Error resilient**: If linking fails, keeps anonymous ID in localStorage so free tier still works

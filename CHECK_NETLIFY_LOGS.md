# üö® URGENT: Check Your Netlify Deploy Log

## The functions are NOT deploying. Here's how to find out why:

### Step 1: Go to Netlify Dashboard
1. Open https://app.netlify.com
2. Click your site
3. Click "Deploys" tab
4. Click the latest deploy (top of list)

### Step 2: Look for the "Functions" Section
Scroll through the deploy log and find a section that says something like:

```
Packaging Functions from netlify/functions directory:
```

### Step 3: Tell Me What You See

**Option A - Functions Built Successfully:**
```
‚úî 3 functions packaged:
  - user-session
  - user-profile
  - messages-generate
```

**Option B - Functions Failed to Build:**
```
‚ùå Error: [some error message]
```

**Option C - No Functions Section:**
```
(Nothing about functions at all)
```

## üîç What to Report Back:

Copy and paste the ENTIRE section about functions from your deploy log.

**OR** tell me which option (A, B, or C) you see.

---

## üéØ Most Likely Issue:

Netlify probably CAN'T FIND the functions or they're FAILING TO BUILD.

This would explain the 404 errors!

**Please check your deploy log now and tell me what it says about functions!**
